# About this project
During my college classes, I sometimes needed to create chats with data.

As I couldn't find a website that I liked, I made it myself. :v:

It has 3 types of charts: bar, line, and pie.

## Technologies
I use `React + Vite` and `react-chartjs-2`

## Set up
`git clone <project-url>`

`npm install`

`npm run dev`

Go to `http://localhost:5173` in your browser
